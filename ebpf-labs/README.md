# eBPF Labs

In these set of labs, we will lean how to write **eBPF** programs and how to use the eBPF language.

We provide several exercises that will help you to learn the basics of the eBPF language.

_Note_: Part of the material that we used for this lab come from the [_XDP Tutorial_](https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial). We would like to thank the authors for their work.

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

To get started with the labs, you first need to install VirtualBox, a virtualization software that will allow you to run a virtual machine (VM) on your machine. You can download VirtualBox from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

### Download the VM

In the PDF file that we provided, you will find a link to download the VM. Once you download the VM, you can import it into VirtualBox by clicking on `File -> Import Appliance...` and selecting the VM file that you downloaded.

### Start the VM

When you start the VM, you will be prompted to enter a username and a password. The username is `ebpf` and the password is `ebpf`.

### Clone this repository into your local machine

Once you are logged into the VM, you can clone this repository into your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Polimi-NetClasses/058172-network-computing-labs.git --recurse-submodules
```

After you clone the repository, you can start working on the labs.
Please, refer to the PDF file that we provide for each lab to get more information about the lab and the instructions to complete it.
